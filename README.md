# Solar_System
A computational physics project to model the orbits of planets in a solar system with planet radii, orbital period and orbital velocity
to scale. A command line menu allows the user to choose to model either view a model of our own solar system, or to create a custom
system including on planets they create based on input parameters: semimajor axis, period, and planet diameter.
This program utilizes the python module graphics.py written by John Zelle, available at http://mcsp.wartburg.edu/zelle/python/graphics.py
